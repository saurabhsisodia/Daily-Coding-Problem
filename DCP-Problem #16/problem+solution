You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. 
Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API: 
  ..record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
  ..get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.



You should be as efficient with time and space as possible





1. We have Fixed items i.e, N, so just create a circular array of max_size=N.
2. Now we can maintain CURRENT which will point to the index where new item will be stored
3. As it is circular so CURRENT = (CURRENT+1) % MAX_SIZE for next index.
4. To get the last i-th item, just get the item at index -> ( CURRENT - i + MAX_SIZE ) % MAX_SIZE i.e, buffer[(current - i + max_size) % max_size]
